## Reason

During 2021 I was hired for teaching. I had a software to use the "whiteboard"
but didn't like it, I wanted it simple. I tried several differents but they all
had the same flaw : they have way too many features.
Recently I stumble upon @ThePrimeTimeagen on Youtube and saw that he used Gimp.

And I thought something could be done, a simple drawing board with not much
fancy features.
